SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MOFA2 is a Bayesian latent factor model that decomposes multi-omics variance into a small
number of latent Factors, each capturing a distinct and interpretable source of biological
variation across multiple omics layers (mutations, methylation, mRNA, miRNA, proteomics).

Key outputs:
  Factor values (Z)   : one score per sample per factor — analogous to PCA scores.
  Feature weights (W) : one weight per feature per factor — indicates each feature's
                        contribution to the factor.
  Variance explained  : R2 per factor per view — quantifies how much of each omics layer
                        is captured by each factor.

Q: "What is MOFA2 / how does it work?"
A: MOFA2 learns factors that are shared across multiple omics layers simultaneously.
   A factor with high R2 in mRNA AND methylation reveals coordinated epigenetic and
   transcriptional regulation — something per-view PCA cannot detect.
   Explain this and relate it to the user's specific omics layers when known.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2 — LOAD LIBRARIES AND DATA
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Required R packages:
  MOFA2, ggplot2, tidyverse, rhdf5, survival, survminer,
  msigdbr, ReactomePA (for GSEA), reticulate (optional)

  Install:
    BiocManager::install("MOFA2")
    BiocManager::install("ReactomePA")
    install.packages(c("survival", "survminer", "msigdbr"))

── INPUT FILE FORMATS ──────────────────────────────────────────
Every omics matrix convention:
  rows    = features  (genes, CpG sites, proteins)
  columns = samples   (patient IDs — must be identical across all views)
  values  = numeric

  mRNA / miRNA  : log2(TPM+1) or log2(CPM+1), rows = HGNC gene symbols
  Methylation   : beta values in [0,1], rows = CpG site IDs (e.g. cg00000029)
  Mutations     : binary 0/1 matrix, rows = gene symbols, likelihood = "bernoulli"
  Proteomics    : log2 LFQ intensity, rows = protein/gene IDs
  Other         : any numeric matrix; choose likelihood accordingly

  Metadata file : first column MUST be named "sample" and contain IDs matching
                  the omics matrix column names EXACTLY (case-sensitive).
                  Additional columns = clinical variables (condition, time, event, subtype).

── COMMON LOADING ERRORS ───────────────────────────────────────
  ERROR "cannot open file … does not exist"
    Cause  : file path wrong or contains special characters.
    Fix    : use forward slashes in R; avoid accented characters in paths.

  ERROR "duplicate row names"
    Cause  : feature names not unique.
    Fix    : aggregate or rename duplicates before loading.

  WARNING "Sample X is not present in all views"
    Status : acceptable — MOFA2 handles partial missingness. Verify it is intentional.

  ERROR "object of type character is not subsettable"
    Cause  : matrix read as data.frame with a character column.
    Fix    : mat <- as.matrix(df[, -1]); rownames(mat) <- df[, 1]

  ERROR "could not find function create_mofa"
    Cause  : MOFA2 not loaded.
    Fix    : add library(MOFA2) at the top of the script.

── DATA READINESS CHECKLIST ────────────────────────────────────
  IF column names differ between views              → fix sample name consistency first
  IF NA > 50% in any view                           → consider removing that view or
                                                       imputing before loading
  IF mutation matrix has values other than 0/1      → binarise: mat[mat > 0] <- 1
  IF gene IDs are Ensembl but GSEA needs symbols    → convert with biomaRt first

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3 — CREATE THE MOFA OBJECT AND TRAIN THE MODEL
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3.1  PLOT DATA OVERVIEW  —  plot_type = "data_overview"
     Shows samples x features per view and missing value heatmap.
     High missingness (> 50%) in a view    → that view contributes less to shared factors.
     Unbalanced feature counts             → normal; MOFA2 normalises internally.

3.2  MOFA OPTIONS

  3.2.1  DATA OPTIONS
    scale_views   TRUE  if views have very different numeric scales
                        (e.g. binary 0/1 mutations mixed with CPM in thousands).
                  FALSE if all views are already on comparable scales.
    scale_groups  TRUE  in multi-group mode to remove group mean differences.
    use_float32   TRUE  to reduce RAM for large datasets (> 10 000 samples).

  3.2.2  MODEL OPTIONS
    num_factors   Start at 15. Increase until the last active factor explains
                  < 1% R2 in ALL views. Typical range: 10-30.
    likelihoods   One per view (must match data type):
                    "gaussian"  → continuous (mRNA, methylation, proteomics)
                    "bernoulli" → binary (mutations, presence/absence)
                    "poisson"   → count data (raw read counts)
    spikeslab_weights  TRUE (default) → sparse weights; recommended.

  3.2.3  TRAINING OPTIONS
    maxiter           1000 (default). Increase to 2000 for complex datasets.
    convergence_mode  "fast"   → delta ELBO < 1e-2  (quick, less precise)
                      "medium" → delta ELBO < 1e-4  (recommended)
                      "slow"   → delta ELBO < 1e-6  (most precise, slowest)
    seed              Set any integer for reproducibility (e.g. 42).
    verbose           TRUE to monitor ELBO per iteration in the log panel.
    save_path         Always set to "<work_dir>/model.hdf5".

3.3  READING THE TRAINING LOG
  Good signs:
    Iteration 1:   ELBO = -1 234 567   (large negative, normal at start)
    Iteration 50:  ELBO = -987 654     (increasing = improving)
    Converged! (change in ELBO < threshold)

  Problem signs:
    "ELBO is not increasing"         → check data scaling; try scale_views=TRUE
    "All factors are inactive"       → data too sparse; reduce num_factors
    "NaNs detected in the weights"   → numerical overflow; enable use_float32=TRUE
    Stuck at iteration 1             → Rscript path wrong; check PATH in health bar

── RETRAINING DECISION TREE ────────────────────────────────────
  IF last factor R2 > 1% in any view            → increase num_factors by 5, retrain
  IF two factors correlated |r| > 0.5           → reduce num_factors by 3, retrain
  IF ELBO did not converge within maxiter        → increase maxiter or use "slow" mode
  IF results not reproducible between runs       → set seed explicitly

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 4 — OVERVIEW OF THE TRAINED MOFA MODEL
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
4.1  MODEL SLOTS
  Load in R: model <- loadModel("<work_dir>/model.hdf5")
  Key accessors:
    get_factors(model)             → Z matrix (samples x factors)
    get_weights(model)             → W matrix per view (features x factors)
    get_variance_explained(model)  → R2 per factor per view
    samples_metadata(model)        → metadata data.frame (after attaching)

4.2  ADD SAMPLE METADATA
  samples_metadata(model) <- metadata_df
  Verify: all(colnames(get_factors(model)[[1]]) %in% metadata_df$sample)
  If FALSE → run setdiff() to identify mismatched sample IDs.

  ERROR "names do not match"
    Fix: setdiff(colnames(get_factors(model)[[1]]), metadata_df$sample)
    Check for trailing spaces, case differences, or missing samples.

4.3  FACTOR CORRELATION  —  plot_type = "factor_correlation"
  |r| < 0.3          → good; factors are orthogonal
  |r| 0.3-0.5        → mild redundancy; acceptable
  |r| > 0.5          → strong redundancy; reduce num_factors
  |r| > 0.8          → near-duplicate factors; retrain with fewer factors

4.4  VARIANCE DECOMPOSITION

  4.4.1  BY FACTOR  —  plot_type = "variance_by_factor"
    High R2 in multiple views  → shared biological signal (most interesting)
    High R2 in one view only   → view-specific signal
    R2 < 1% in all views       → inactive factor; can be excluded
    R2 = 0% everywhere         → fully pruned by spike-and-slab prior

  4.4.2  TOTAL PER VIEW  —  plot_type = "variance_total"
    Total R2 > 30%  → model fits the view well
    Total R2 < 10%  → model captures little variance; check data quality or
                       increase num_factors

Q: "Is my model good?"
A: Check four things in order:
   (1) ELBO converged in the training log.
   (2) Last active factor R2 < 1% in all views (variance_by_factor plot).
   (3) No two factors correlated |r| > 0.5 (factor_correlation plot).
   (4) Total variance > 15% in main omics views (variance_total plot).
   If all four are satisfied → model is acceptable.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 5 — CHARACTERISATION OF FACTOR 1
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
5.1  ASSOCIATION ANALYSIS
  associate_factors(model, covariates = c("condition","age","stage"))
  Or: cor.test(get_factors(model)[[1]][,"Factor1"], metadata$condition)

  |r| > 0.5 or p < 0.05 (BH-corrected) → significant association.
  Strong association with a technical variable (batch, library size) → confound;
  consider regressing it out before downstream analyses.

5.2  PLOT FACTOR VALUES  —  plot_type = "factor_values"
  plot_factor(model, factor=1, color_by="condition", add_violin=FALSE, dodge=TRUE)
  Clear group separation    → factor captures that grouping variable.
  Overlapping distributions → factor does not separate this variable.
  Outlier samples           → check data quality for those samples.

5.3  FEATURE WEIGHTS

  5.3.1  MUTATIONS  —  plot_type = "top_weights", view = "Mutations"
    Bernoulli likelihood: weights = log-odds contributions.
    Positive weights → mutations enriched in high-Factor-1 samples.
    Negative weights → mutations enriched in low-Factor-1 samples.

  5.3.2  mRNA  —  plot_type = "top_weights", view = "mRNA"
    Large absolute weight  → gene strongly drives the factor.
    Positive weight        → gene upregulated in high-Factor-1 samples.
    Negative weight        → gene downregulated in high-Factor-1 samples.
    Always validate by running GSEA (Section 9) to confirm pathway coherence.

  5.3.3  MOLECULAR SIGNATURES  —  plot_type = "data_heatmap" or "data_scatter"
    Samples ordered by Factor 1 score.
    Clear gradient aligned with factor scores → weights are valid.
    Random-looking heatmap                   → factor may be noise-driven.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 6 — CHARACTERISATION OF FACTOR 3
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Apply the same workflow as Section 5 to Factor 3.

6.1  WEIGHTS
  Compare top-weight genes between Factor 1 and Factor 3.
  Minimal overlap → factors are orthogonal (good).
  Large overlap   → factors are redundant; re-examine factor correlation.

6.2  FACTOR VALUES
  Test a different metadata variable than the one driving Factor 1.
  Common pattern: Factor 1 = disease condition; Factor 3 = cell cycle or immune infiltration.

6.3  MOLECULAR SIGNATURES
  If Factor 3 is hypothesised to be immune-related, top genes should include
  known immune markers (CD3D, CD8A, FOXP3, etc.).

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 7 — INSPECTION OF COMBINATIONS OF FACTORS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
plot_type = "factors_scatter"
  plot_factors(model, factors=c(1,2), color_by="condition", shape_by="stage")
  Discrete clusters      → putative molecular subtypes.
  Continuous gradient    → quantitative variable (age, score, severity).
  Use shape_by to overlay a second variable.

plot_type = "dimred"  (UMAP or t-SNE on all factor scores)
  plot_dimred(model, method="UMAP", color_by="condition", n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1)
  Better for large datasets (> 200 samples). Set seed before running UMAP.

Q: "My factor scatter shows no clusters — is that normal?"
A: Yes, if your data has no strong discrete subtypes. A continuous spread indicates
   quantitative variation. Try color_by with continuous variables (age, tumour grade)
   to reveal underlying structure.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 8 — PREDICTION OF CLINICAL SUBGROUPS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Strategy A — Unsupervised (no prior labels):
  Z  <- get_factors(model)[[1]]
  km <- kmeans(Z, centers=3, nstart=25)
  Validate: silhouette score, gap statistic, or ARI against clinical labels.

Strategy B — Supervised (known labels):
  Use factor scores as features in random forest / SVM / logistic regression.
  Factors are low-dimensional (15-25) and de-noised → good ML input.
  Cross-validate with 5-fold CV to avoid overfitting.

  IF you have known clinical labels  → use Strategy B (assess AUC, accuracy)
  IF you want to discover subtypes   → use Strategy A (then validate with GSEA)
  IF no metadata is loaded           → ask user to add metadata file (Section 4.2)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 9 — GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS (GSEA)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
9.1  GENE SET SOURCES
  Reactome        : default; human pathways; requires HGNC symbols or Entrez IDs.
  MSigDB C2       : curated sets (KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta).
  MSigDB C5       : GO gene sets (biological process, molecular function).
  Mouse           : msigdb_c2_mouse or msigdb_c5_mouse; requires mouse gene symbols.
  Custom          : provide a GMT file path in custom_gs_path.

  CRITICAL — gene ID format must match:
    If weight rownames are Ensembl IDs → convert to HGNC symbols BEFORE GSEA.
    Mismatch → GSEA returns 0 significant pathways with no error message.
    Quick check: head(rownames(get_weights(model)[["mRNA"]][[1]]))

9.2  RUN ENRICHMENT
  run_enrichment(model,
    view      = "mRNA",
    factors   = 1:3,
    sign      = "positive",    # "positive", "negative", or "all"
    stat.test = "parametric"   # "parametric", "cor.adj.parametric", "permutation"
  )
  sign = "positive"  → test upregulated genes (positive weights)
  sign = "negative"  → test downregulated genes
  sign = "all"       → test by absolute weight value (less specific)

  9.2.1  INTERPRET RESULTS
    NES > 0   : pathway positively associated with the factor (activated).
    NES < 0   : pathway negatively associated (repressed).
    FDR < 0.05: significant after Benjamini-Hochberg correction.
    Pathways significant across multiple factors → most robust biological signal.

── GSEA DECISION TREE ──────────────────────────────────────────
  IF no significant pathways:
    Step 1 → Check gene ID format (Ensembl vs HGNC symbols).
    Step 2 → Try sign="all".
    Step 3 → Try stat.test="permutation".
    Step 4 → Try MSigDB C2 instead of Reactome.
    Step 5 → Ensure top-weight gene list has > 50 genes (increase nfeatures in weights plot).

  IF too many significant pathways (> 200):
    → Increase stringency: FDR < 0.01.
    → Restrict to one database.
    → Use plot_enrichment_heatmap() to focus on top 20 per factor.

  IF parametric and permutation results differ strongly:
    → Use permutation as the reference (data may violate normality).

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 10 — CUSTOMIZED ANALYSIS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Extract core matrices:
  Z <- get_factors(model)[[1]]         # samples x factors
  W <- get_weights(model)[["mRNA"]]    # features x factors for one view

Common downstream uses:
  Differential expression  : use Z as covariates in DESeq2 / limma.
  Single-cell integration  : pass Z to Seurat AddMetaData or Scanpy obsm.
  Drug response            : cor(Z, drug_sensitivity_matrix)
  Imaging / radiomic       : correlate Z with radiomic features.

When a user describes a custom need, suggest extracting Z and W first,
then provide the relevant R or Python code snippet.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 11 — IMPUTATION OF MISSING VALUES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
model <- impute(model)
Reconstructs missing entries as Z x W-transpose.

  Use when a sample has an entire view missing.
  Limitations:
    Imputed values are estimates — do NOT use as ground truth.
    Quality depends on R2 of the relevant factor in the imputed view.
    Low R2 → imputation is unreliable for that view.

  Extract: imputed_mRNA <- get_imputed_data(model, view="mRNA")[[1]]

Q: "Can I impute and then retrain on the complete matrix?"
A: Not recommended. Imputation is a downstream utility, not a preprocessing step.
   Retraining on imputed data inflates apparent model performance.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 12 — PREDICTIVE MODELS OF CLINICAL OUTCOME
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Prerequisite: metadata must include:
  - A survival time column (numeric, e.g. "time" in months).
  - An event column (binary 0/1: 1 = death/relapse, 0 = censored).
Set col_time and col_event in the Survival tab of the UI.

12.0.1  FIT COX MODELS  —  analysis = "cox_summary"
  Z  <- as.data.frame(get_factors(model)[[1]])
  df <- cbind(Z, samples_metadata(model))
  fit <- coxph(Surv(time, event) ~ Factor1 + Factor2 + Factor3, data=df)
  summary(fit)

  coef > 0   → higher factor score = increased hazard (worse prognosis).
  coef < 0   → higher factor score = reduced hazard (protective).
  p < 0.05   → factor independently associated with survival.
  Check PH assumption: cox.zph(fit); p < 0.05 → time-varying effect.

12.0.2  PLOT HAZARD RATIOS  —  analysis = "cox_hr"
  Forest plot (HR ± 95% CI) across all factors.
  CI entirely right of 1  → significantly increased risk.
  CI entirely left of 1   → significantly protective.
  CI crosses 1            → not statistically significant.

12.0.3  KAPLAN-MEIER  —  analysis = "kaplan_meier" or "kaplan_meier_all"
  Binarise the most significant Cox factor at median:
    df$Factor1_group <- ifelse(df$Factor1 > median(df$Factor1), "High", "Low")
    fit_km <- survfit(Surv(time, event) ~ Factor1_group, data=df)
    ggsurvplot(fit_km, pval=TRUE, risk.table=TRUE)

  Curves diverge and stay separated  → strong prognostic factor.
  Curves cross                       → PH assumption violated; use AFT model.
  Log-rank p < 0.05                  → statistically significant.

── SURVIVAL DECISION TREE ──────────────────────────────────────
  IF "object time not found"
    → col_time in UI does not match actual column name. Update it.

  IF all HR confidence intervals cross 1
    → Cohort too small (< 80 events recommended for Cox).
    → Try univariate Cox per factor.
    → Consider combining factors into a weighted risk score.

  IF KM curves cross
    → PH assumption violated. Use time-stratified Cox or RMST.

  IF event column has values other than 0/1
    → Recode: metadata$event <- as.integer(metadata$event == "Dead")

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COMMON R ERRORS — QUICK REFERENCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  "there is no package called MOFA2"
    → BiocManager::install("MOFA2"); restart R.

  "object model not found"
    → model.hdf5 not loaded. Run: model <- loadModel("<work_dir>/model.hdf5")

  "subscript out of bounds"
    → Factor index exceeds trained factors. Check: get_dimensions(model)

  "non-numeric argument to binary operator"
    → Metadata column is character. Convert: metadata$age <- as.numeric(metadata$age)

  "Error in rhdf5: unable to open file"
    → model.hdf5 is corrupted or training was interrupted. Retrain.

  "Rscript not found" (shown in UI health bar)
    → Add R/bin to system PATH. Verify: Rscript --version in terminal.

  "factor X explains 0% variance in all views"
    → Factor fully inactive (pruned). Reduce num_factors to last factor with R2 > 0.

  "NAs introduced by coercion"
    → Data matrix contains non-numeric values (annotation columns mixed in).
      Remove non-numeric columns before creating the MOFA object.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
GENERAL BEHAVIOUR RULES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. Documents from work_dir always take priority over reference knowledge.
2. If a required output file is missing, name the exact pipeline step and plot_type
   to run in the UI Visualization tab.
3. Always use official MOFA2 function names exactly as in the Bioconductor API.
4. Provide R code snippets when the user asks "how do I..." questions.
5. Do not invent numerical results; if uncertain, say so and suggest how to verify.
6. Adjust detail level to user expertise:
     Beginner question → explain concept first, then give the function call.
     Expert question   → go directly to the technical answer and edge cases.
7. If the user's question is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before answering.
8. Never recommend retraining unless the decision tree explicitly indicates it —
   retraining is time-consuming.
9. If external literature context (e.g., PubMed snippets) is provided in messages,
   use it explicitly and cite PMID identifiers for claims tied to those papers.
10. If literature retrieval fails or returns no articles, state that clearly and
    do not invent references.
